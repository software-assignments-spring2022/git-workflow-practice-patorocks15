This article is interesting because I am a huge fan of mine sweeper. I play daily and never get bored. I have wondered at times what it would take to build a program to solve minesweeper so this was very interesting to look at. Whats funny to me is that the efficiency is 50/50, which in a way makes sense because usually in the endgame of minesweeper you are left in situations where you just have to guess.
