This article is interesting because I am a huge fan of mine sweeper. I play daily and never get bored. I have wondered at times what it would take to build a program to solve minesweeper so this was very interesting to look at. Whats funny to me is that the efficiency is 50/50, which in a way makes sense because usually in the endgame of minesweeper you are left in situations where you just have to guess.

The way I used to play minesweeper when I was a child is randomly click at any place. I considered it as a lottery game and never tried to dig deeper into it. I like the article but it doesn't actually discuss the actual code used for the algorithms.
